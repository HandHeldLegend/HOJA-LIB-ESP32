# _BASIC GAMEPAD EXAMPLE_
This is the simplest buildable example for a HOJA controller.

## How to use this controller example
Wire up your controller according to the definitions in the main.c
All buttons should simply connect the GPIO pin to ground. Once started,
the gamepad will show as a BLE XInput gamepad for devices that have BLE support.
